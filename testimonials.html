							<p>Here are some of the comments we have received from our clients.</p>
							<p>"King Audio Transcription and Typing Services has been a pleasure to work with. Through our initial meeting, KATTS proved to be very pleasant and helpful. All email correspondences were very prompt and provided all the information I needed. Arranging the transfer of files was quick and easy. The transcriptions were accurate and turned around rapidly. The pricing of the services was very reasonable and clearly explained.</p>
							<p>I fully intend to use KATTS in the future and will recommend them to anyone needing these services."</p>

							<p>“Sarah provides a valuable service to my organisation in producing accurate transcription services. The quick turnaround time she provides helps me to programme our work schedule more easily. She is a great contact and I have recommended her services to colleagues and both internal and external”</p>
							<p class="center">***</p>
							<p>"Sarah had the unenviable task of transcribing hours and hours of digitally recorded interviews for my PhD research. Her accuracy was excellent, turnaround time very fast and overall communication first class. Both my Professor and another colleague working on a PhD have since used her services and have been equally as positive about Sarah's work for them." </p>

							<p>"It was wonderful to return back from my holidays to find all 4 focus groups transcribed. I have checked all of the files and they look great to me. Many thanks for the prompt and thorough job."</p>
							<p class="center">***</p>
							<p>"Thank you so much Sarah for all your hard work. I really appreciate it. I will keep you posted on how I get on with my MA."</p>
							<p class="center">***</p>
							<p>"I really really appreciate your help with this, it has made such a difference, I would have still been lumbering on with them but I've managed to start on one of my other chapters instead.
							Thank you so much again."</p>
